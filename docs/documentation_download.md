The UKDS files come bundled with study documentation in `.pdf` format within the `mrdoc/` subfolder - for instance, technical reports, questionnaires, user guides, etc. The files do not always have the most user-friendly titles, so we have written code to instead download documentation from the CLS study pages.

The code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/CLS-Data/cohort-documentation.git). To use the code, first download or clone the GitHub directory.

-   To download the directory, on the GitHub website, click `Code -> Download ZIP` (see screenshot below) then unzip the downloaded file and place it in a suitable location on your computer.
-   To clone the directory, open your computer's command line or terminal, navigate to an appropriate location (`cd ...`) and type `git clone https://github.com/CLS-Data/cohort-documentation.git`. You may want to rename the folder from `cohort-documentation` to `CLS Documentation` or something similar.

When the folder is downloaded, open the `README.md` file and follow the instructions therein.

Once completed, the folder should look like the below.
